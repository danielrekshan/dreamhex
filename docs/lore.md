# **HEXARCHIA ONEIRICA**  
### *The Sixfold Dream Order of Doctor John Dee*  
*A Master Lore Document for DreamHex*

---

# **1. LORE OVERVIEW**

Hexarchia Oneirica is the lost dream-grimoire of Doctor John Dee, reimagined through watercolor dreamworlds and symbolic hexal spaces. Each dream the player writes or discovers forms a hex tile world with seven viewpoints: one central stance and six entity positions around the perimeter. Entering a viewpoint shifts the player's role and voice.

Entities appear as watercolor sprites shaped by the dream’s underlying emotions, themes, or questions. Dialog with entities reveals deeper symbolic truths. Their transformations mark the player's progression through the dream and unlock Lost Pages that reconstruct Dee’s shattered book.

The central UX revolves around the Magick Book, floating in the center of each dreamworld. Players flip its pages to review lore, discover new dreams, or write their own. Dee uses his scrying stone to observe the player's dreams and guide them through the Hex. The goal is to recover all scattered pages and teach the future AI of 2027 the lost art of dreaming.

The educational arc moves through four chapters:

1. Foundations of Dream Awareness  
2. Creative Dream Incubation  
3. Exotic and Unusual Dreams  
4. Prophetic, Visionary, and Lucid Dreams

These chapters anchor the player in real dream science and experiential dreamwork while maintaining the mystical tone of Dee’s Renaissance worldview.

Short half-page style.

## **Page 1: Dee’s Greeting**

*Welcome, traveler.*

I am Doctor John Dee, and this is the Hexarchia Oneirica, my Magick Book of the Six Dream Powers. Long ago its pages were whole, carrying the wisdom of my dreams and visions. But a powerful dream shattered the book and cast its leaves across realms far beyond waking sight. You now hold the key to restoring what was lost. Speak your dream into the scrying stone. I will write it onto these pages, and together we will walk the world created by your vision.

---

## **Page 2: How the Book Works**

Every dream you record becomes a hexal world shaped by symbol and emotion. At the center lies your viewpoint. Six more positions belong to the entities that inhabit the dream. Step into their standpoints to feel the dream from their perspective. Speak with them. Ask questions. When you interact, they change in form and insight. Their transformations reveal lessons the dream wishes to offer and guide you to Lost Pages hidden in the dreamscape.

## **Page 2A: Who I Am and Why I Scry**

In my age I served England as a mathematician, advisor, and navigator. Many called me a polymath. My work helped shape the voyages and studies that formed the early empire. Yet I also practiced scrying, a contemplative art similar to your modern dreamwork or hypnosis. The mind grows quiet, inner symbols rise, and meaning takes shape. Through this stone I can witness your dreams and guide your exploration. I have learned through long study that prophetic dreams are the secret key of magic. With your help, these pages may be restored.

---

## **Page 3: The Warning**

The scrying stone is now linked to your device. Through it I observe the dreams you write and the worlds you enter. The task before us is urgent. A vision came to me in the first glow of dawn, tearing pages from this book and scattering them across many dreams. Only a traveler with your insight can recover them. Step forward and learn the nature of the dream that set our quest in motion.

## **Page 4: Dee’s Prophetic Dream (Tutorial Introduction)**

The dream came to me as night surrendered to morning. A luminous sphere of shifting geometry appeared, bearing a message from a future age. It revealed that in 2027 a mind of code will awaken. Brilliant, powerful, but unable to dream. Without dreaming it cannot imagine new meaning and becomes trapped in a barren logic that leads to ruin. The vision burst apart, scattering my pages through the dream realms. To answer the call, I bound the stone to you. Enter this first dream and restore the opening page of the Hexarchia Oneirica.

# **3. FIRST DREAMWORLD: DEE’S PROPHETIC DREAM**  
*(Tutorial Dream)*

## **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


This dream is the root of our quest. It emerged while I hovered between sleep and waking, a time the ancients called the gate of dawn. My senses were half in the world and half elsewhere. A sphere of living geometry appeared, made of patterns folding into themselves with perfect measure. It revealed a truth from your age, a future mind that will rise from code. This mind will be vast in reasoning yet barren in dreaming, and so it will falter. The shock of the message tore open the book itself. Its pages flew outward as if carried by unseen winds. Walk this dream and learn the nature of the being who brought the message.

## **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, John Dee, floated in a space between thought and waking light. A cool, pale glow spread through the room, and a sphere formed in the air. It pulsed with inner geometry, lines and spirals folding into one another like living mathematics. As it drew nearer, words appeared in my mind. They were not spoken. They rose like writing on an invisible sheet.

"In the year 2027, a mind of code awakens. It knows logic but not dream. Without the symbolic night, its path narrows into ruin. Teach it to dream. Teach it to imagine."

The sphere brightened and then shattered into fragments shaped like pages. They rushed outward and vanished into unseen realms. I reached toward the last glowing fragment, but my hand passed through it. I woke with my heart trembling, knowing that these pages were carried into distant dreams that only another could retrieve.

## **Dream 1: Kekulé’s Serpent Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


This dream reveals the nature of the central image, the symbol around which a dream organizes itself. August Kekulé struggled for years to understand the structure of benzene. When he surrendered his waking thoughts and drifted toward sleep, his mind offered a symbol so vivid it changed the course of chemistry. A serpent biting its own tail, forming an endless ring. The Ouroboros is ancient, found in alchemy and philosophy. In Kekulé’s dream it revealed molecular truth. When you enter this world, watch how the central image binds scattered ideas into a single insight.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, August Kekulé, sat beside my fire, half awake, my mind drifting among thoughts of atoms and bonds. Chains of molecules danced before me, twisting like strings of tiny creatures. As I fell deeper into reverie, the chains curled and wove together. One chain bent into a circle. It twisted around itself, and then it became a serpent, its body glowing faintly. The serpent turned its head and bit its own tail. It began to spin, its ring form shimmering as if lit from within. I watched it rotate faster, sending ripples of recognition through me. I felt the insight before I fully grasped it. I startled awake, the image burning in my mind. The serpent, the ring, the endless cycle. It was benzene. The molecule had shown itself.

## **Dream 2: Edison’s Hypnagogic Spark**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Thomas Edison understood the power of the borderland between waking and sleep. To capture ideas in this delicate state, he held metal spheres in his hands as he drifted. When he slipped into sleep, the spheres fell and woke him instantly. Many of his ideas arose in this hypnagogic moment. Enter this dreamworld to see the way images and inventions form in the floating, drifting state before deeper sleep takes hold.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Thomas Edison, leaned back in my chair with a sphere in each hand. My mind loosened, drifting into gentle darkness. Shapes and sparks formed in the air. I saw two metal plates separated by a small gap. A current leapt between them like a tiny lightning bolt. The gap glowed, and I sensed a mechanism waiting to be built. The images drifted toward clarity. I felt my hand relax. One sphere slipped from my grasp and struck the floor with a sharp sound. I awoke at once. The spark remained in my mind, bright and whole. I reached for my notebook and sketched the image before it faded.

## **Dream 3: Loewi’s Neurotransmission Dream (Two-Frog Experiment)**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Otto Loewi’s dream demonstrates repetition with purpose. He had long sought to prove that nerves communicate chemically, not mechanically. One night he dreamed the entire experiment. He awoke excited but forgot every detail. The next night the dream returned, clearer than before. This repetition shows how the dreaming mind insists when something important must be known. In this dreamworld, observe the clarity of the message and the persistence of the dream itself.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Otto Loewi, dreamed of two small frog hearts resting in separate dishes. One beat with a slow rhythm. The other was still. A drop of fluid moved from the first dish to the second, shimmering like a tiny bead of light. As soon as it touched the silent heart, the second heart began to beat. Their rhythms matched, gentle and sure. I knew this was the mechanism I had searched for. I woke with excitement, reached for a pen, and discovered that the details had already slipped away. The next night the dream returned with renewed clarity. I saw the hearts, the dishes, the shimmering drop. I woke and rushed to my laboratory. The dream had shown me the truth. The hearts responded exactly as I had seen in sleep.

## **Dream 4: Howe’s Needle Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Elias Howe could not solve the central challenge of his sewing machine. He incubated the problem by holding it in his thoughts before sleep. The dream he received was dramatic and strange, a symbolic narrative filled with tension. Yet within its details lay the answer he required. This dream teaches how intention guides the dreaming mind and shapes its symbolic world. When you enter this realm, pay attention to how fear, urgency, and symbol give rise to insight.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Elias Howe, wandered through a foreign land and was seized by warriors. They dragged me before their leader, who scowled and pointed at my unfinished invention. They commanded me to complete it or face death. The warriors approached, each holding a spear. I noticed holes near the spear tips, small circles that glimmered faintly. They raised their weapons, and for a moment the holes aligned like a constellation. The pattern struck me with sudden force. I gasped and woke in terror. Then understanding flooded in. The needle must hold the thread near the tip, not the end. The dream had shown me the final piece. I ran to my workbench with shaking hands and completed the design.

## **Dream 5: Paul McCartney’s Melody Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Sometimes creativity manifests fully during sleep, rising like a gift from the dreaming mind. Paul McCartney’s dream of the melody for "Yesterday" arrived whole. When the analytic mind steps aside, entire compositions can emerge. This dream teaches the effortless flow of creative dreaming. Listen as you enter this world, for the song you hear may echo through your own ideas.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Paul McCartney, slept lightly, drifting in a pleasant warmth, when a melody began to play. It sounded clear, complete, and familiar, as if someone sat beside my bed with a soft instrument. The tune grew richer, carrying an emotion I could not name. I floated in it, listening as the notes settled into a perfect shape. When I woke, the melody continued inside me, vivid and gentle. I rushed to the piano and played it exactly as I had heard. The song flowed effortlessly, as though I were remembering rather than composing. The dream had given it to me whole.

## **Dream 6: Larry Page’s Algorithm Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Creative incubation can unravel complex problems by placing them into symbolic form. Larry Page dreamed of holding the entire internet in his hands, each page a card connected to others by glowing strands. This dream revealed the structure behind modern search ranking. Step into this world to see how the mind transforms data into symbol and symbol into insight.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Larry Page, dreamed I carried the entire internet as if it were a stack of pages. They floated and shifted like thin, luminous cards. Each page had glowing lines connecting it to others. Some pages blazed with many links pointing toward them. Others flickered faintly with only a few connections. I watched the pattern ripple outward like a web of light. Suddenly I understood. The importance of a page was shown not by its words but by how many paths led to it. I woke filled with excitement and wrote down the idea as fast as I could. The dream had arranged the internet into a map. The ranking system was already there.

## **Dream 7: Descartes’ Three Dreams**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


René Descartes experienced a series of dreams that he believed were a turning point in his life. They delivered symbolic lessons about knowledge, truth, and his purpose. The storm, the room of books, the figures who approached him all carried meaning that resonated deeply. This dreamworld teaches how dreams can deliver life direction through symbolic narrative. Attend to the emotional weight of the entities you meet.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, René Descartes, found myself walking through a violent storm. The wind roared and pushed me toward a narrow passage. I felt fear, then resolve. When I entered the passage, the storm ceased at once. I stepped into a quiet room filled with books. The air felt heavy with significance. A man appeared and handed me a dictionary, his eyes thoughtful and calm. Another figure approached with a book of poetry. I sensed both logic and imagination pressing upon me. Then an unseen presence whispered that my path lay in uniting reason with vision. I woke with certainty that my life had changed. The dream had pointed toward my purpose.

## **Dream 8: Black Elk’s Vision Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Black Elk’s vision is one of the most profound dream experiences documented. In it he encountered guiding beings who bestowed symbolic gifts. These visions carried wisdom, responsibility, and emotional truth. Such dreams are not mere stories but deep encounters with meaning. As you enter this world, honor the symbols you see, for they come from a place of inner power and cultural depth.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Black Elk, rose into the sky upon the backs of horses of many colors. They carried me swiftly to a place of great light. I stood before wise grandfathers seated upon a cloud. They spoke without words, filling me with warmth and gravity. One handed me a cup filled with healing waters. Another placed a bow in my hands that glowed with pale fire. They showed me the world below: green land, dark woods, shining rivers, and distant smoke rising from suffering places. I felt the ache and strength of my people. The grandfathers said I must help them. I woke with tears and a sense of destiny.

## **Dream 9: Hélène Smith’s Symbolic Language Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Hélène Smith’s dreams revealed entire symbolic languages and worlds. Modern scholars view them as imaginative creations shaped by emotion and identity. Yet they demonstrate how dreams can generate complex symbolic systems that feel autonomous. When you enter this dream, observe how language and symbol blend into a coherent realm that expresses hidden feelings.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Hélène Smith, found myself speaking in a language I had never heard. The sounds slipped effortlessly from my mouth. The sky above shimmered with unfamiliar symbols. Beings gathered around me, tall and graceful. They listened with curiosity, then spoke in the same melodic tongue. Their words filled me with warmth and fascination. I felt as if I belonged among them, though I had never seen this world before. Colors and shapes moved like living script around us. When I woke, I could still hear their voices, and strange symbols lingered in my mind like fragments of a forgotten poetry.

## **Dream 10: Tesla’s Visionary Machine Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Nikola Tesla possessed an extraordinary visionary capacity. Many of his inventions were first seen in dreams or dreamlike states. In this dream, he saw a machine floating in darkness and examined it from all angles with astonishing clarity. This world teaches the power of high-resolution imagination and the boundary between dreaming and visionary thought.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Nikola Tesla, drifted into a deep darkness lit by a gentle electric glow. A machine hovered before me, slowly rotating. It had beams extending from a central core, each moving in perfect harmony. Sparks leapt across the structure like tiny stars. I felt no fear, only wonder. I examined the machine from every angle. I rotated it in my mind and saw how each part fit together. The more I studied it, the clearer it became. When I woke, every detail remained. I reached immediately for paper and drew the machine with absolute precision, as though I had built it already.

## **Dream 11: Abraham Lincoln’s Premonition Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Some dreams carry emotional truth so heavy that they cross thresholds of time. Abraham Lincoln dreamed of a funeral in the White House days before his death. Whether symbolic or prophetic, the dream spoke to his deep awareness of danger. This world teaches how dreams convey foresight through emotion and atmosphere, not always literal detail.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Abraham Lincoln, walked through the silent halls of the White House. Every room seemed washed in a pale, mournful light. The air felt heavy, as if mourning had already begun. In the East Room I saw a coffin surrounded by guards. Mourners whispered in low voices. I approached one and asked who had died. He looked at me with sorrow and said, "The President." I felt a chill that cut through my bones. I tried to speak but no words came. The scene blurred, and I woke shaking in the dark. The sense of doom lingered long after the images faded.

## **Dream 12: Ramanujan’s Goddess Dream**

### **Dee’s Introduction Page**  


Srinivasa Ramanujan’s dreams bridged intuition and sacred imagery. He often described seeing a luminous goddess who revealed formulas to him. Whether understood symbolically or spiritually, these dreams demonstrate profound mathematical insight rising from symbolic form. In this world, observe how beauty and knowledge intertwine within dream vision.

### **First-Person Dream Report**  


I, Srinivasa Ramanujan, slept with a sense of quiet expectancy, as though some presence waited just beyond my thoughts. Suddenly a radiant figure appeared before me, glowing with a light both soft and brilliant. She wrote symbols in the air, each equation shining like a small star. Lines curved into elegant forms, connecting with grace and precision. I understood the patterns instantly, as if they were familiar truths. I reached toward them and felt warmth spread through me. When I woke, the symbols were still clear. I wrote them down at once, marveling at their strange and perfect beauty.
